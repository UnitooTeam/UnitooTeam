We are an Italian IT company founded by people dedicated to free as in freedom software, working with ethical principles and agile methodologies.

### Some curiosities about us:

- We are committed to using, as much as possible, Free as in Freedom hardware, like System76 hardware
- We use mostly Free as in Freedom software, even for our customers
- We own a free as in freedom radio dedicated to CC Music and Podcasts (https://radio.unitoo.it)
- Every weekend our team is involved in a random project around the world in a Challenge called: The Open Source Weekend Contributing Challenge For Every Unskilled Gender Fluid Compliant People. Obviously the name is a joke, but the Challenge exists.
